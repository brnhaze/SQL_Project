## Project Description
  # Extracting data from a SQL database
  # Cleaning, transforming and analyzing data
  # Loading data into a database
  # Developing and implementing a QA process to validate transformed data against raw data

## Project Instructions
  ### Part 1: Loading csv Files into Database
    - Create Database (dB) called "ecommerce"
    - Set up tables
      - Resources
        - https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/import-csv-file-into-posgresql-table/
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jf7eTkIaR4
  ### Part 2: Data Cleaning
  ### Part 3: Starting with Questions
  ### Part 4: Starting with Data
  ### Part 5: QA Your Data

## Submission Guidelines
  1. README.md file
    - This file should be an overview of your project, covering roughly the same points as your presentation
  2. cleaning_data.md file
    - Fill out this file with a description of the issues that will be addressed by cleaning the data
    - Include the queries used to clean the data
  3. startingwithquestions.md file
    - Provide the answer to the 5 questions and the queries used to answer each question
  4. startingwithdata.md file
    - Provide the 3 - 5 new questions you decided could be answered with the data
    - Include the answer to each question and the accompanying queries used to obtain the answer
  5. QA.md file
    - Identify and describe your risk areas
    - Develop and execute a QA process to address the risk areas identified, providing the SQL queries used to implement
  6. schema.png file
    - This file should contain the ERD of the database

## Evaluation Ruberic
  - SQL
    - Implements advanced SQL techniques/skills
      - (i.e. changing data type or creating custom field within SQL query)
  - Data Acquisition
    - Finds relevant data sources with thought given to source reliability and the data quality.
    - Parses data efficiently
  - Data Audit
    - Identifies potential issues with quality and quantity of data and fixes issues at the source of the data .
    - Generates hypothesis of what can be done with the data.
  - Data Cleaning
    - Thinks beyond basic data cleaning techniques to consider additional data issues
    - (i.e. capitalization of text)
  - Tool Installation & Set Up
    - Recommends problem specific tools and can set up any tool stack required.
  - Coding Comprehension
    - Comments code using best practices for variable names, syntax etc.
    - Further explanation of code is not required.
  - Organization
    - README.md is well written, easily understood, and precise instructions are included.
    - Files created can easily be shared with others.
    - File organization allows for easy collaboration with others.

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
- Create a functioning database with relationships
- Clean the data
- Query and answer questons easily

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
- Creating relationships was difficult; I had to review and had a chat with Alibek
  - I chose to create Intermediate Tables to complete this task.
- Some columns such as productSKU and sku were difficult to eliminate characters to create a shortened unique value.
- I did not understand what some of the questions were asking.
- I had a difficult time trying to remember or choose what form syntax.
  - Failed at many but kept trying until working.
- Still having a hard time distinguishing which Subqueries to use and writing CTE's for questions I did not understand was not easy.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
- I would like to be able to write more user-defined scripts. The one I wrote was not easy but I managed after watching some Youtube videos.
- Practicse using different functions and being able to recognize which windows-function may be best.
